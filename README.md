# Safe-critical Smart Toaster

**Semestral project for safe critical controlling toaster using STM32H747I-DISCO.**

## Motivation

Do you have a regular toaster at home? What if you could turn it into a smart device that prepares warm toast for you at a precise time? So when you go to bed at night, you prepare everything, and in the morning, you have warm toast ready on your plate.

The goal of my project is to create a device that will allow controlling the toaster through a user interface. The device will enable delayed start.

## Features

- LCD witch touch screen control
- multi-core communication (using shared memory and using atomic variables)
- software emulated timer
